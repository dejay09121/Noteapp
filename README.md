# Description
The Notes App is a mobile application built with React Native (Expo) and Supabase that allows users to securely create, edit, and manage personal notes. Users can register and verify their accounts through email authentication, ensuring that all stored notes are private and linked to their unique profile.

The app supports text notes and media attachments, allowing users to upload images or videos that are safely stored using Supabase Storage. A clean and simple interface lets users view their notes, update content, and organize their ideas efficiently. The app is designed with real-time responsiveness, secure backend services, and a smooth user experience, making it a lightweight but powerful digital notebook for everyday use.
